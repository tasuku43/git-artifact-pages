# Git Artifact Pages — Specification

Status: **design baseline / pre-MVP**

This document captures the intended product contract. Some implementation details are deliberately left open until the local reference implementation validates them.

## 1. Product definition

Git Artifact Pages is a Git-backed platform for publishing static artifacts as searchable, browsable websites.

A typical source artifact is generated or maintained in a Git repository, for example:

- HTML reports
- architecture explanations
- design documents
- generated visualizations
- incident reports
- review artifacts
- documentation bundles

The product preserves Git as the source of truth while presenting artifacts through a normal web experience.

## 2. System model

      ↓

      ↓
object storage
      ↓
CDN / HTTP server
      ↓
browser SPA
~~~

There is no required application server in the browser request path.

### 2.1 Application plane

The application plane changes relatively infrequently.

~~~text
/index.html
/assets/*
~~~

It contains the SPA shell and its versioned JS/CSS assets.

The initial SPA implementation is Vite + React + TypeScript.

### 2.2 Content plane

The content plane changes as artifacts are published.

~~~text
/_indexes/*
/_artifacts/*
~~~

It is independently deployable from the application plane.

## 3. Site

A **site** is the first logical segment of a user-facing route.

Examples:

~~~text
/sre
/frontend
/platform
~~~

Therefore /sre/incidents/123.html means:

- site: sre
- logical artifact route: incidents/123.html

A site is a logical destination, not a repository identity. The initial builder maps one repository source directory to one site. Combining sources from multiple repositories is deferred until a concrete use case requires it.

## 4. User-facing routing

The browser contract is intentionally small:

~~~text
/            site selection
/:site       site home
/:site/*     artifact view
~~~

Storage implementation paths are internal details and should not become the primary URLs users share.

Example:

~~~text
user URL:
/sre/incidents/123.html

internal artifact URL:
/_artifacts/sre/incidents/123.html
~~~

The SPA resolves the logical route and loads the corresponding artifact. Indexed document routes
retain their full source-relative path, filename, and extension; `/:site` remains the separate site-home route.

## 5. Storage projection

The initial projection shape is:

~~~text
/
├── index.html
├── assets/
├── _indexes/
│   ├── sre.json
│   ├── frontend.json
│   └── platform.json
└── _artifacts/
    ├── sre/
    ├── frontend/
    └── platform/
~~~

### 5.1 Site discovery

The local reference implementation discovers available sites from the directory listing at `/_indexes/`, then loads each per-site index file.

Each `<site>.json` file is the source of that site's display metadata. No separate `sites.json` registry is required for the local product.

The directory listing changes when sites are onboarded, renamed, or removed. It does **not** change for each artifact publication unless the set of site files changes.

An object-storage/CDN adapter may provide an equivalent static listing or a generated catalog. The production representation is intentionally not fixed by the local milestone; the requirement is that root site selection remains serverless.

### 5.2 Per-site index

Each site has one public index:

~~~text
/_indexes/<site>.json
~~~

Example:

~~~json
{
  "schemaVersion": 2,
  "site": {
    "id": "sre",
    "title": "SRE"
  },
  "generatedAt": "2026-09-22T00:00:00Z",
  "artifacts": [
    {
      "id": "incidents/123.html",
      "title": "Incident 123 Review",
      "path": "incidents/123.html",
      "format": "html",
      "artifactUrl": "/_artifacts/sre/incidents/123.html",
      "updatedAt": "2026-09-22T00:00:00Z",
      "lastCommitter": {
        "name": "Octocat"
      },
      "source": {
        "repository": "example/sre",
        "repositoryUrl": "https://github.com/example/sre",
        "ref": "main"
      },
      "toc": [
        { "level": 1, "text": "Summary", "id": "summary" },
        { "level": 2, "text": "Root cause", "id": "root-cause" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
~~~

The important public contract is one index per site. Schema version 2 adds the `format` field
(`html` or `markdown`) and uses the exact source-relative document path as its stable identity.

The builder indexes `.html`, `.htm`, and `.md` documents as individual artifacts. `id` and `path`
are the exact source-relative path, including filename and extension; `artifactUrl` points to the
unchanged file under the artifact tree. `index.html`, `README.md`, and other documents are opened
explicitly and do not act as implicit directory landing pages. Thus `foo.html` and `foo.md` are
distinct pages and routes. Static resources such as CSS, JavaScript, images, and fonts are available
to pages but are not independently indexed.

For Markdown, the first H1 supplies the display title, with a readable filename fallback when there
is no H1. Markdown headings are indexed for Contents, and generated heading IDs match the reader.
HTML retains its `<title>`-based display title and existing precomputed heading behavior.

### Publishable source directory

The builder's `sourcePath` is the exact static content tree intended to be served beneath `/_artifacts/<site>/`. It may contain directly authored static files or output from another site generator, but HTML and Markdown must already be ready to publish: this builder does not expand templates, run site generators, bundle CSS or JavaScript, rewrite resource URLs, or copy files.

The builder recursively indexes every `.html`, `.htm`, and `.md` file under that tree, including root-level and nested `index.html` files. Every page uses its full source-relative filename and extension in its route; index files do not alias their parent directories. No directory-name or dotfile heuristic excludes pages; for example, HTML or Markdown under `_includes/` is indexed if that directory is inside `sourcePath`. Select a publishable root that contains the pages to expose and excludes source-only templates or partials.

Local resources referenced by those pages must also be present under `sourcePath`, with their relative directory structure intact. External resources may be referenced over HTTPS under the artifact resource policy described below. The index builder leaves the tree unchanged and emits metadata only; a later publish step is responsible for copying the tree unchanged beneath the site's artifact namespace.

`sourcePath` must be inside the current Git working tree. Tracked source files provide commit-based `updatedAt` and `lastCommitter` metadata. Files without Git history, including ignored or generated output, remain indexable; for them `updatedAt` falls back to filesystem modification times and `lastCommitter` is omitted. Prefer tracked, publishable documents when Git-derived details are required.

The index should eventually contain enough information to support:

- recent artifacts
- title search
- filename/path search
- tree navigation
- source/path grouping where useful
- table of contents
- deep links

The browser should not need S3 ListObjects or equivalent runtime storage listing APIs.

## 6. Artifacts

Artifact bytes are served beneath:

~~~text
/_artifacts/<site>/...
~~~

The platform does not define "static artifact" by file extension. HTML may depend on:

- CSS
- JavaScript
- images
- SVG
- fonts
- JSON
- WASM
- other static relative resources

The publisher therefore works on declared source paths / mounts, not on a hard-coded extension allowlist.

Relative resources should work naturally because artifact directory structure is preserved in the storage projection. Resolve ordinary HTML references from the artifact document URL, CSS `url()` references from the stylesheet URL, and module imports from the importing module URL.

Artifact-owned resources should normally use relative URLs that stay within their artifact directory. A root-relative URL such as `/assets/report.css` starts at the origin root and does not retain the `/_artifacts/<site>/...` namespace; enough `../` segments can also leave the artifact tree. Sites may contain identical relative paths and filenames; while references stay within their artifact directories, their full URLs remain distinct because each site's tree has its own prefix. Missing artifact resources should return a real 404, not the SPA fallback document.

## 7. Artifact viewer

Artifacts should initially be displayed using an iframe.

Reasons:

- preserve normal relative URL behavior
- isolate artifact CSS from the application shell
- avoid injecting arbitrary HTML into the SPA DOM
- allow normal browser HTML and JavaScript behavior for published artifacts
- keep the SPA focused on navigation and discovery

The iframe intentionally has no `sandbox` attribute. Publishing an artifact is the trust boundary: published HTML is treated as approved executable content and can use normal browser capabilities.

The hosting layer sends an enforced Content Security Policy that allows resources from the current logical site's `/_artifacts/<site>/` path and from HTTPS origins. This lets ordinary browser-rendered HTML load remote CSS, JavaScript, images, fonts, media, and fetch/XHR resources when the browser's normal TLS, CORS, and mixed-content rules permit them. Insecure external HTTP resources remain blocked. Inline scripts, styles, and eval remain allowed because published artifacts are trusted.

The `https:` source is intentionally broad: it matches resources from any HTTPS origin, including other logical-site paths on the application's own HTTPS origin. Therefore the path source is not a cross-site isolation boundary when the application is served over HTTPS. Do not use `'self'` as a replacement; all logical sites share one origin. This behavior is acceptable only under the current trust model, where publishing an artifact means approving its active content and network requests. Browsers may disclose ordinary request metadata to remote resource hosts.

The policy does not confine redirects to an artifact path: an allowed HTTPS resource may redirect to another HTTPS URL. Any future hosting adapter must preserve the HTTPS-resource behavior and the same trusted-publisher assumption. If mutually untrusted publishers or private artifacts need isolation, use a per-site HTTPS-origin allowlist or a separate origin before supporting that use case.

Artifacts are served from the same origin as the SPA under `/_artifacts/*`. The policy does not isolate artifacts: an artifact script can access the parent application and other same-origin resources, and the broad HTTPS source permits same-origin HTTPS requests outside its site prefix. This product trusts published artifacts rather than isolating hostile publishers. If private or authenticated content, or mutually untrusted publishers, become part of the product, artifact hosting must move to a separate origin and the security model must be revisited before that use case is supported.

The right-hand table of contents should use precomputed index metadata rather than requiring the parent application to inspect the iframe DOM.

## 8. Browser UX

Target layout:

~~~text
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Git Artifact Pages                         Search        │
├─────────────────┬─────────────────────────┬──────────────┤
│                 │                         │              │
│ Artifact tree   │ Artifact viewer         │ Contents     │
│ filters/search  │ iframe                  │ H1 / H2 / H3 │

└─────────────────┴─────────────────────────┴──────────────┘
~~~

### Root route

/ presents site selection using static registry metadata.

### Site home

/:site discovers and loads /_indexes/<site>.json and initially presents recent artifacts, expected to start with roughly the latest 10 entries.

### Search

Search is client-side against the site index for the initial implementation.

Initial searchable fields:

- title
- path
- filename where available

Search should feel immediate after the index is loaded.

### Left sidebar

The left sidebar derives a tree/navigation model from the site index. It may support filtering without additional network calls.

### Main pane

HTML artifacts are loaded from `/_artifacts/*` into the iframe. Markdown artifacts are rendered in
the application's native reader within the same workspace.

The Markdown reader supports CommonMark and GitHub Flavored Markdown, including tables, task lists,
strikethrough, autolinks, and footnotes. Mermaid code fences are rendered client-side in strict
security mode, with diagram interactions disabled. Embedded raw HTML is sanitized before entering
the application DOM. Relative assets resolve from the Markdown file's location. Links to other
indexed Markdown or HTML documents navigate to their extension-preserving application routes.

### Right sidebar

The optional right panel has two views, toggled from the workspace header:

- **Contents** displays table-of-contents metadata and navigates to heading anchors in the artifact.
- **Details** displays the last Git committer, last-updated date, and source repository link/ref.

Both views use the same overlay panel so opening metadata does not narrow or reflow the artifact. `updatedAt` describes the artifact's last relevant source update, not the index generation time. `lastCommitter.name` is the committer name recorded in Git for that latest relevant source change; it is not a claim about the artifact's original author or a resolved GitHub account. Commit email addresses are not included in the public index. `source.repositoryUrl` is the canonical clickable repository URL, while `repository` remains its display name.

## 9. Initial builder source model

The initial index build consumes one source per site:

~~~text
(repository, ref, sourcePath)
~~~

Artifact paths and IDs are relative to `sourcePath`; repository identity is recorded as metadata, not exposed in the site's public route. For example:

~~~yaml
site: sre
repository: company/sre-monorepo
ref: main
sourcePath: docs/artifacts
~~~

An artifact-only repository can use its root as the source:

~~~yaml
site: sre
repository: company/sre-artifacts
ref: main
sourcePath: .
~~~

There is no mount-path merge in the initial builder. A later publisher may add explicit mounting if a validated use case needs it.

## 10. Multiple repositories in one site (deferred)

This is a possible future capability, not an MVP requirement. The initial builder does not merge multiple repositories or require a registry to allocate mount paths.

Example:

~~~text
site: sre

/incidents     ← company/sre
/architecture  ← company/platform
/runbooks      ← company/operations
~~~

If multi-repository publishing is introduced, the registry must guarantee that mount paths within a site do not overlap.

Invalid examples:

~~~text
/reports
/reports
~~~

and:

~~~text
/reports
/reports/security
~~~

Parent/child overlap is rejected because a publisher using delete/sync semantics could affect another publisher's namespace.

The public projection still presents one /_indexes/sre.json.

How multiple publisher contributions might be staged and merged into that single index is a future implementation concern. Source-specific manifests are one possible internal mechanism, but are not required by the browser-facing contract or the initial builder.

## 11. Registry

The eventual platform registry is the authority for:

- site identity
- source repository
- ref
- sourcePath
- mountPath
- publish authorization

Repository workflows should not be able to arbitrarily choose another source's destination namespace.

Normalization rules should reject at least:

- duplicate mount paths
- ancestor/descendant mount overlap
- ..
- reserved platform namespaces
- invalid site IDs

The exact registry format is not required for the local browser milestone.

## 12. Publish-time metadata

Where practical, metadata is produced at publish time instead of browser request time.

Candidate metadata:

- title
- logical path
- filename
- updated time
- last committer recorded by Git
- commit SHA
- source repository
- source repository URL
- source ref
- headings / TOC
- optional tags
- optional description

HTML display-title extraction uses the HTML title element. Markdown display titles use the first H1.

Sidecar metadata may be added later if HTML alone is insufficient.

The initial local builder records the Git committer name for the latest relevant artifact change. It does not infer a GitHub account or expose the committer email; commit activity also supplies `updatedAt`.

## 13. Local reference implementation

Local development should reproduce the production routing contract without AWS.

Target:

~~~text
Browser
   ↓
nginx (Docker Compose)
   ├── /_indexes/*   → fixture/generated static files
   ├── /_artifacts/* → fixture/generated static files
   └── everything else → Vite SPA index.html
~~~

Committed fixture data lives separately from generated local state.

Recommended convention:

~~~text
fixtures/storage/   committed representative projection
.local/             generated/untracked projection
~~~

The local product should be usable before any AWS code exists.

## 14. Testing direction

Target testing layers:

- Vitest for domain/unit behavior
- Storybook for isolated UI states
- Storybook interaction tests for component behavior
- Playwright for full navigation and routing behavior

Important E2E flows include:

- root → choose site
- site home → recent artifact
- sidebar filter → artifact selection
- deep-link directly to an artifact
- reload preserves route
- iframe loads nested relative artifact assets, modules, and data from the artifact's site namespace
- Markdown routes retain `.md`, render H1 / GFM / Mermaid, and navigate through Contents links
- relative Markdown images resolve within the same site's artifact tree
- CSP permits external HTTPS resources and blocks external HTTP resource fetches
- missing artifact resources return 404 rather than the SPA shell
- artifact styles remain inside the iframe document
- published scripts retain normal same-origin browser capabilities
- TOC navigation reaches an artifact heading

VRT can be introduced later for the stable application shell. Arbitrary artifact contents should not become the primary VRT responsibility.

## 15. AWS reference architecture

AWS is the first intended production adapter, after the local contract is stable.

Expected static architecture:

~~~text
Git
 ↓
GitHub Actions / publisher
 ↓
private S3
 ↓ OAC
CloudFront
 ↓
Browser
~~~

Expected CloudFront routing has three conceptual behaviors:

~~~text
/_indexes/*    → static index content
/_artifacts/*  → static artifact content
Default (*)    → SPA shell
~~~

The first two patterns do not overlap, so their relative order is not semantically important. The default behavior is the fallback.

SPA routes such as `/sre/incidents/123.html` must resolve to the application shell rather than being looked up as literal S3 object keys. The AWS adapter will therefore need an SPA fallback/rewrite mechanism.

The S3 bucket remains private and CloudFront reads it through Origin Access Control.

## 16. Cache model

The application and content planes have different lifecycles.

Expected direction:

~~~text
/index.html             short/revalidated
/assets/<hashed>*       long/immutable

/_indexes/*             short/revalidated
/_artifacts/*           cache according to publication model
~~~

Artifact paths may later become commit-addressed/immutable, which would allow aggressive CDN caching. That is an optimization, not an MVP requirement.

## 17. Publishing and AWS credentials

The intended GitHub-to-AWS path uses GitHub Actions OIDC rather than long-lived AWS access keys.

Publishers should eventually be scoped to the S3 prefixes they own.

The exact IAM model belongs to the AWS/publisher phase.

## 18. Access control

Repository read permission and website viewer permission are separate concerns.

The first AWS reference implementation may support simple deployment-level controls such as:

- network/IP restrictions
- Basic Authentication
- an existing organizational identity layer

Mirroring GitHub repository ACLs for each viewer is not an initial goal.

## 19. Distribution model

The eventual OSS distribution is expected to be a set of versioned components rather than one copied template.

Possible surfaces:

~~~text
core / CLI
bundled SPA
Terraform AWS module
GitHub Action
reusable workflow examples
~~~

The core product contract should not require AWS. AWS is a reference infrastructure adapter.

Do not freeze package/repository boundaries before the local and AWS implementations validate the contracts.

## 20. Non-goals for the MVP

- server-side rendering
- database
- request-time search API
- browser-side S3 ListObjects
- per-viewer GitHub OAuth authorization
- PR/branch preview environments
- arbitrary dynamic backend execution
- a generalized documentation CMS
- automatic interpretation of every possible HTML/browser feature

## 21. Architectural invariants

Treat changes to these as architecture decisions:

~~~text
Git is the source of truth.

The served system is a static projection.

The SPA application plane and artifact content plane are independently deployable.

A site is a logical namespace, not a repository identity.

The initial builder maps one repository source to each site; multi-repository merging is deferred. If it is introduced later, mount paths within a site must not overlap.

The browser consumes per-site indexes discovered through the local `/_indexes/` listing; it does not use browser-side object-storage ListObjects APIs.

Artifacts live under /_artifacts.

Indexes live under /_indexes.

Logical user routes do not expose the storage projection as the main UX.

Prefer publish-time computation over request-time services.
~~~
