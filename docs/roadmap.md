# Roadmap

The roadmap is intentionally staged. Each phase should prove a stable contract before the next infrastructure layer is added.

## Phase 1 — Local product

Build the product locally without AWS.

Target stack:

- Vite
- React + TypeScript
- nginx
- Docker Compose
- fixture indexes and artifacts
- Vitest
- Storybook interaction tests
- Playwright E2E

Target user experience:

- / shows available sites.
- /:site shows the site home and recent artifacts.
- /:site/* deep-links to an artifact.
- Left sidebar shows a searchable/filterable artifact tree.
- Main pane renders the selected artifact in an iframe.
- An optional right panel switches between indexed contents and artifact details (last committer, update date, and source).
- Direct navigation and reload restore the same state.

VRT is optional at this stage and should focus on the application shell rather than arbitrary artifact contents.

## Phase 2 — Local projection builder

Build the per-site index from one Git repository source directory:

~~~text
source repository + sourcePath
        ↓
_indexes/<site>.json
~~~

The initial Go command consumes one publishable static content directory inside a Git working tree. HTML must already be ready to serve; the index builder does not run templates or another site's build, bundle CSS/JavaScript, rewrite URLs, or copy files. It recursively indexes every `.html`/`.htm` file except a root-level `index.html`/`index.htm` (the site landing document); nested index documents use their parent directory as their route, and other filenames retain their filename in storage while using an extensionless logical route. There are no implicit path exclusions, so the selected directory must not include source-only HTML partials such as `_includes` unless they are intended to be published as artifacts.

The builder extracts display metadata and computes update times from Git history and working-tree changes. It records the Git committer name for the latest relevant change, without resolving a GitHub account or publishing the committer email. Untracked files, including ignored generated output, remain indexable, but their update time falls back to filesystem modification times and they have no `lastCommitter`. The command does not copy artifact bytes or publish to a hosting provider; a later publish step should copy the selected static tree unchanged so its relative resources continue to work.

The full source tree is scanned on each build. Temporary file-count fixtures cover 1,000, 5,000, and 10,000 source files (100, 500, and 1,000 HTML pages); Git-history fixtures cover 500 and 1,000 HTML pages with 51 commits. These measurements inform whether incremental indexing is needed; do not add it until the measured build cost warrants the complexity.

Use one repository source per site for this milestone. Registry enforcement, mount ownership, multi-repository merging, and provider publishing are deferred until the static index contract is validated.

The public contract should remain simple even if internal merge/staging mechanics evolve.

## Phase 3 — AWS reference deployment

Provide a reference AWS deployment:

- private S3 origin
- CloudFront
- Origin Access Control
- SPA fallback/rewrite
- cache policies appropriate to application, indexes, and artifacts
- optional access controls
- GitHub Actions OIDC for publishing

Prefer Terraform for the reference infrastructure.

## Phase 4 — Reusable distribution

Package the system so another organization can adopt it without copying implementation code.

Expected distribution surfaces:

- CLI / core package
- bundled SPA
- Terraform AWS module
- GitHub Action
- reusable workflow examples

Do not lock these package boundaries until Phases 1–3 make the contracts clear.

## Before an OSS release

- choose an OSS license
- define compatibility/versioning policy for index and registry schemas
- document security assumptions for arbitrary HTML/JavaScript artifacts
- document upgrade and rollback behavior
